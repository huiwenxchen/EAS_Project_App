Meyer, and Charles Lang Freer negotiated with Marcel Bing to arrange a joint purchase of Bing\u0027s collection of 11 Chinese bronzes and 1 jade. See correspondence cited in note 2. The Meyers and Freer decided to divide the collection - Meyers acquiring 5 bronzes (including this object) and Freer acquiring 6 bronzes in addition to the jade -- and the price, calculating each party\u0027s payment was based on the appraisal values assigned to each piece. The Meyers ultimately sent the entire payment to C. T. Loo, Lai Yuan \u0026 Company (sometimes appears as Lai-Yuan), who in turn wired money to Bing. Lai Yuan \u0026 Company received a consigners fee from Bing. Meyers made the payment in early December 1915, with Freer paying the Meyers for the objects destined for his collection on December 14, 1915.
