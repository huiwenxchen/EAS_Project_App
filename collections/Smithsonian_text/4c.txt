Thomas Way Sr. acquired several of these works at the time of Whistlerâs bankruptcy, and he passed some of them on to his son (see The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855-1903, ed.

However, museum records do not always specify whether it was the younger or elder Way who was the source of a particular object.

Freer, he would concurrently negotiate the sale of some of his fatherâs Whistler works to Freer. In cases where it is unclear whether it was the junior or senior Way who actually owned a piece acquired by C.L.
